# Hi, I'm Supun Kalhara

I’m a full-stack developer from Sri Lanka who loves building web applications that are both reliable and user-friendly. Whether working on the frontend or backend, I focus on writing clean, maintainable code that delivers great experiences.

Alongside, I enjoy creating custom WordPress websites that fit the unique needs of each client.

Right now, I’m diving into AI integrations, exploring backend architectures, and automating tasks to make development smarter and more efficient.
